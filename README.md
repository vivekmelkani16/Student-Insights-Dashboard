# Student Insights Dashboard

This project is a data-driven dashboard designed to analyze and visualize student performance. By examining key factors such as academic scores, attendance rates, and extracurricular activities, it provides valuable insights into the elements that influence academic success.

***

### üìä Key Features

* **Performance Analysis**: Analyzes student academic scores across different subjects (e.g., Math, Science, English).
* **Correlation Discovery**: Identifies the relationship between attendance rates and overall academic performance.
* **Extracurricular Impact**: Explores how participation in extracurricular activities correlates with academic success.
* **Data Visualization**: Generates insightful plots including histograms, bar charts, box plots, and scatter plots to present findings clearly.
* **Interactive Dashboard**: Includes a Power BI dashboard to allow for dynamic filtering and exploration of the data.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **Python**: The core programming language for data analysis.
-   **Pandas**: Used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
-   **NumPy**: Utilized for numerical operations and data generation.
-   **Matplotlib**: Employed to create static data visualizations and plots.
-   **Power BI**: A business intelligence tool used to create an interactive dashboard for deeper insights.

### üöÄ How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/vivekmelkani16/Student-Insights-Dashboard.git](https://github.com/vivekmelkani16/Student-Insights-Dashboard.git)
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, run the following command to install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```
### Step 3: Execute the Python Script

Run the main script to generate the sample data and all the visualizations.

```bash
python student_dashboard.py
```
### üìà Power BI Dashboard
The `student_data.csv` file generated by the Python script can be imported into Power BI to create an interactive and dynamic dashboard.

* **Import Data**: Use the **"Get Data"** function in Power BI and select **"Text/CSV"** to import the `student_data.csv` file.
* **Build Visuals**: Create visualizations such as bar charts to compare scores by subject, scatter plots to show the attendance-score correlation, and slicers to filter data.
